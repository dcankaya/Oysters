  <h4 id="list-item-1">Reusable Silicone Sandwich Bag</h4>
  <p> Silicone Sandwich Bags are great for packing school and work lunches to go. As the name implies they can be reused, but even if they do get disgarded they are much better for the environment than the classic plastic sandwich bags.</p>
  <h4 id="list-item-2">Tupperware Containers</h4>
  <p>These also are great for on the go lunches. They are also handy when it comes to storing leftovers in the refrigerator. YOu can even make pre-prepared meals in them and they are generally microwave safe. They also come in a number of different sizes to fit your needs.</p>
  <h4 id="list-item-3">Metal Reusable Straws</h4>
  <p>Many restaurants are getting rid of straws but for those that have not and on occaisons where you just want to sip from a straw, metal straws are great alternatives to the platic ones. Many of them come with a straw clearner and it is a one-time investment. They also come on key chains so you can attach the straw to your bag and take it wherever you go.
  </p>
  <h4 id="list-item-4">Cloth Towels</h4>
  <p>Cloth towels are a great product to have on hand in the kitchen. They are more environmentally friendly than paper towels and can mop up a spill just as effectively.</p>
  <h4 id="list-item-5">Laminated Bowl Covers</h4>
  <p>Laminated bowl covers are a great substitute for plastic wrap!</p>
  <h4 id="list-item-6">Foldable Grocery Bags</h4>
  <p>Foldable grocery bags are a handy product for grocery shopping and often save you a few cents for bringing your own bag. They are also easily stored and eliminate the need for plastic bags at stores.</p>
  <h4 id="list-item-7">Mrs. Meyers Brand Dish Soap</h4>
  <p>Mrs. Meyers is just one brand among others but the important part is that it is an environmentally friendly dish soap. Many people overlook the fact that dish soap is a pollutant, so make sure, the next time you're out shopping to seek out eco-friendly dish soap.</p>
  <h4 id="list-item-8">Broccoli</h4>
  <p>In terms of envionrmentally friendly food products, broccoli is a great one to consume. Broccoli can produce its own protection and thus doesn't need pesticides making it an eco-friendly vegetable to produce.</p>
  <h4 id="list-item-9">Oranges</h4>
  <p>Another healthy food item to consider consuming more often. Oranges are great because compared to other fruits they require substancially less water to grow.</p>
  <h4 id="list-item-10">Composter</h4>
  <p>Another great product to have on hand is a composter. There are many household small composters sold these days and this is a great way to lessen food waste and give back to the earth. You can even make you're own fertilizer to use in gardening!</p>
